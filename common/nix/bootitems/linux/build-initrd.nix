# Nix derivation that creates a minimal initrd for Linux.
#
# The initrd sets up a minimal typical Linux environment and contains CLI tools
# from busybox, bash as shell, and optionally additional tools. Before it hands
# over control to the shell, it ensures that typical device nodes and kernel
# file systems, such as /dev/, /sysfs, /tmp, and /proc are available.
# Basically, this forms the userspace of a custom tiny Linux distribution.
#
# The user sees a bash shell. Once the bash shell is exited with CTRL+D or
# `exit`, the system is powered off.
