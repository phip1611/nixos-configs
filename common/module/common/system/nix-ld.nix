# Run unpatched dynamic binaries on NixOS

# Note: Since NixOS 23.05 the setup got quite convenient and the official README
#       on GitHub is outdated at the moment.
#
# This is for example useful to enable a dynamic binary used by the Rust plugin
# of Jetbrains IDE. Without it, CLion tells warnings that say
# "could not learn about target-specific information from rustc".

    # better to set the env var NIX_LD_LIBRARY_PATH only for specific bins, such
    # as through a nix shell.
